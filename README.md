Welcome to ChaChingAcademy!

We created this project for a hackathon with the idea of giving financial education to high school and college minority students. 

Our inspiration: 

As a group, we realized that we were not fully prepared to understand credit cards, 
investing, and other financial responsibilities. We felt that school did not provide 
enough detail during high school, and we wanted to help people like us avoid having 
those same issues. So we decided to build a website looking to provide services to 
high school and college minorities to equip them with knowledge and tools to achieve 
a better future.

What it does: 

It is a website that helps high school and college minorities gain access to knowledge 
and explore alternative ways to make money, such as investing or retirement. We also provide 
a version of gemini that is trained on public information regarding good financial decisions. 
We offer advisors that specialize in financial planning, wealth management, retirement planning, 
tax strategies, and business advisory.

How we built: 

We built it using JavaScript, HTML, CSS.

Accomplishments:

Used/Learned new tools such as Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ, Node.js, GitHub, and BootStrap. Proud 
of completing this group project as it's 3/4 of our teams first hackathon. Networking and meeting 
group mates last minute which led to the planning, execution, and results of our project.
