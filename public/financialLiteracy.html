        Ever wondered how much money you would have made if you started
        investing the moment you where born?
      </h1>
      <p>
        Well, think no more! If you had started investing $1,000 in
        <span id="companyName"></span> on <span id="dob"></span>, your account
        value would be at <span id="price"></span> right now! That is a
        <span id="gainPercentage"></span> increase!

        Stocks are a way to own a piece of a company. When you buy a stock,
        you're buying a share of that business. There are two main types: common
        and preferred stocks. You don’t need to be an expert to get started,
        just knowing that stocks can help build wealth over time is enough to
        begin your journey. It’s all about growing your money as the company
        grows, and a little bit of understanding goes a long way.
      </h2>

        Stocks represent ownership in a company, and when you purchase a stock,
        you are essentially buying a small piece of that company. It’s important
        to understand that there are two main types of stocks: common and
        preferred. Common stocks give you voting rights and the potential for
        dividends and capital appreciation, while preferred stocks typically
        offer fixed dividends but no voting rights. Stocks are one of the most
        accessible ways for everyday individuals to grow their wealth over time,
        and understanding how they work is the first step toward making smart
        investment choices.

      <h4>Why it matters to you?</h4>
      <p>
        For minority communities, investing is more than just building personal
        wealth—it’s about breaking barriers. Financial independence is something
        that has historically been hard to achieve for many minorities, but
        learning how to invest can help change that. By investing, we can start
        closing the wealth gap and creating opportunities for ourselves and
        future generations. You don’t need to have a lot of money to start, just
        the willingness to learn and take small steps toward a brighter
        financial future.
